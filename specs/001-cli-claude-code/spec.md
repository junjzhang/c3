## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer using Claude Code, I want a simple CLI tool to manage dotfiles and project templates. I should be able to symlink configuration files globally for my user account or copy template files to initialize new projects, with optional installation scripts.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am a new user, **When** I install a global template, **Then** configuration files are symlinked to my user directory and I'm prompted to run any install.sh script
2. **Given** I am working on a project, **When** I apply a project template, **Then** template files are copied to my current directory and I'm prompted to run any install.sh script
3. **Given** I have access to a configuration repository, **When** I list available templates, **Then** I can see all available templates with descriptions
4. **Given** configurations have been updated in the source repository, **When** I sync my configurations, **Then** my symlinked configurations are automatically updated
5. **Given** a template contains an install.sh script, **When** I apply the template, **Then** I'm asked whether to execute the installation script

### Edge Cases
- What happens when symlinking conflicts with existing files in user directory?
- How does the system handle network connectivity issues when accessing the Git repository?
- What occurs when user permissions prevent symlinking or script execution?
- How does the system behave when the configuration repository is unavailable?
- What happens when copying template files to a directory that already has those files?
- How does the system handle install.sh scripts that fail during execution?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a command-line interface for dotfiles and template management
- **FR-002**: System MUST support global dotfiles management through symbolic links
- **FR-003**: System MUST support project template initialization through file copying
- **FR-004**: System MUST use a Git repository as the source for templates and dotfiles
- **FR-005**: System MUST list available templates from the configuration repository
- **FR-006**: System MUST sync global configurations by pulling from the Git repository
- **FR-007**: System MUST prompt users to execute install.sh scripts when present in templates
- **FR-008**: System MUST warn users about file conflicts before overwriting
- **FR-009**: System MUST authenticate with the Git repository using standard Git authentication methods

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Template**: A directory containing configuration files and optionally an install.sh script
- **Dotfiles**: Configuration files that are symlinked globally to the user's home directory
- **Project Template**: Template files that are copied once to initialize a new project
- **Configuration Repository**: Git repository containing all available templates and dotfiles
- **Install Script**: Optional install.sh file within a template that handles tool installation
